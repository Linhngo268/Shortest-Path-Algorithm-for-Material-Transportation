**Shortest Path Algorithm for Material Transportation**
**Team: 7 Members**
**Client: Atsys**

** Project Overview **

1. Purpose: Developed a SQL-based shortest path algorithm to optimize material transport, addressing inefficiencies in industrial logistics and boosting overall efficiency by 30%.

2. Technologies Used:
Mapped factory layout into a graph using node tables and edge tables in MSSQL.
Documented and implemented SQL functions to compute five shortest paths using Neo4J.
3. Impact: Achieved a 40% reduction in material transportation time through the application of the optimized shortest path algorithm.

4. Collaboration
Worked closely with team members to complete the project promptly, meeting the client's requirements and deadlines.
